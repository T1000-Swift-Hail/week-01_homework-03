You learned about the String type and printing to the console using print(). Use your new playground to create a new instance of the String type. Set the value of this instance to be equal to your last name. Print its value to the console.

## Steps:
- Create a new playground named "MyLastName".
- Create a new instance of the String type.
- set the instance to be equal to your last name.
- Print its value to the console.



## Bonus:
- Create an instance of the type Int.
- Set its value to your age.
- print in the console "My last name is < your last name > and I am < your age > years old"

*hint: use string interpolation*
